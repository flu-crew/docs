== Methods for manipulating trees

I will describe methods here through a series of examples.

=== Pandemic H1 - filtering down a giant clade

You have just retrieved H1 pandemic sequence from the last few years and want
to do something awesome with it. With `smof`, you can see how many sequences
you have:

----
$ smof stat pdm.fna
nseq:      26802
nchars:    26257059
5sum:      1 982 982 982 991
mean(sd):  980 (29)
N50:       982
----

Oh crap, one of our sequences has a length of 1.

----
$ smof filter -s 100 pdm.fna
>|A/Jacarei/1495954-IAL/2020|H1N1|human|BRA|||2020-02-29
a
>|A/Presidente_Venceslau/1261099-IAL/2019|H1N1|human|BRA|||2019-08-13
a
>|A/Goiania/1435-IAL/2019|H1N1|human|BRA|||2019-09-07
c
>|A/Sao_Paulo/167/2016|H1N1|human|BRA|||2016-01-04
g
>|A/Sao_Paulo/725017/2018|H1N1|human|BRA|||2018-02-27
g
----

The HAs were trimmed to the HA1 region, so these sequences are simply truncated
sequences. We can either filter them out or change our methods to not trim.
I'll go with the third option of leaving them in and building the tree (since
this is the tree section).

----
$ mafft pdm.fna | FastTree -nt -gamma -gtr > pdm.tre
----

This will take awhile to run, since there are nearly 27 thousand strains. The
result tree is shown <<fig:tree1, below>>.

We want to root it on California/07/2009 and then sort it. This can be done
with the `treebender` utility from the phylommand package
(https://github.com/RybergGroup/phylommand):

----
$ treebender --outgroup_root "vaccine|A/California/07/2009|human" pdm.tre | treebender --ladderize > pdm2.tre
----

The outgroup name needs to be an exact match against the tip label. The result is much cleaner:

But this tree is far too large for our purposes. We need to subsample. However,
since we are interested in human-swine transmission, we need to preserve the
overall topology of the tree with respect to the two species. If we just
sampled 5% of the tips, we would loose most of the non-persisting spill-over
cases. `smot` can sample for us while preserving the topology.

----
smot sample para --keep "swine" --seed 42 -p 0.02 --min-tips=3 --factor-by-capture="(human|swine)" pdm2.tre > pdm3.tre
----

This yields a much more manageable tree with only 2643 tips. The black and
orange represent human and swine sequences, respectively.

[#fig:tree3]

If you just want to see the swine, `smot` can grep them out:

----
smot grep "swine" pdm3.tre > pdm-swine.tre
----

Or if you want to remove the private VDL sequences:

----
smot grep -v "VDL" pdm3.tre > pdm-no-vdl.tre
----
